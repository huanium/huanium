Sound in Spin-imbalanced 

- superfluid + normal fluid

Nice paper: https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/0709.3027/

Puddles?

Spin imaging to distinguish normal and superfluid??

23 Hz axial confinement to compensate for gravity (might have to worry)

Hollow core in harmonic trap --> 50/50 

Collective excitations of polarons in harmonic trap

Spin imbalance: Landau-Zener sweep (sweep magnetic field, or sweep the rate)

=============================

F = 3/2, F = 1/2 --> 6 hf states. 

High field, same magnetic moment. Feshbach resonance --> 1,2,3 look similar in high field

1<->2: resonance 832 G. There's a minimum at -300a_0. zero-crossing at 530 G


How to make mixture 1-3? In ODT, start with 1, go to Feshbach zero crossing of 1-3 (530 G). LZ sweep 
to send half of 1 to 2. Then do a slower LZ to send 2 to 3. Then LZ again to send 2 to 5, to clean up 
state 2. 5 is radially anti trapping (low field seeking).

After all this, suddenly ramp to 690 G to strongly interacting regime. Ramp fast because there's a
less energetic molecular state existing below. So, right at Feshbach resonance it's okay. 

Three atoms --> two form a pair, the other guy carries away all energy and momentum

Alternatively can make 1-3 by 2-photon RF. Could also do Rabi. 

===================================

Magnetic field stablization: use IGBT (since high currents). To sense curren currently use 50 Ohm Hall probe.
Worry about 60 Hz AC. What's limiting how narorw we can do thnings. 10 ms.

Noise probably from power supply. To get high precision stuff probably need better machines.
60 Hz might be due to poor stabilization... for now not important, but probably due to something accidental,
or to use feedforward.

======================================


BEC1 Sequence:

- Evap2 of mag trap (clover leaf, no plug)
- load into ODT (Na = 2 2, Li = 3/2 3/2)
- Evap so that Na gone 
- spin flip Li to ground state
- 6->1 sweep - sweep the magnetic field (3/2 3/2) -> (1/2 1/2) LZ (takes 5-10 ms)
- LZ must be coherent --> must ramp, can't jump when sweeping.
