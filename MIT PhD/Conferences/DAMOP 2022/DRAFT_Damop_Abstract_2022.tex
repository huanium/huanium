\abstract{The unitary, contact-interacting Fermi gas is challenging to treat numerically or analytically, but is also relevant to a wide variety of physical systems thanks to its scale invariance. We prepare a spin-balanced, homogeneous gas of fermionic $^6$Li, trapped within a box potential formed by blue-detuned light. We observe the response of the gas to local [density and temperature] perturbations in both the normal and superfluid phases and extract the associated diffusivities. These diffusivities are at a Heisenberg limit $\sim \frac{\hbar}{m}$ and contrast with the predictions of Fermi liquid theory, informing new models.\\
