            It's been three weeks since I last posted. There hasn't been much progress in the lab as we spent quite a
            big chunk of time trying to obtain a diode laser that would lase at the correct frequency for our next experiment
            (electromagnetically induced transparency). Speaking of which, I realize I haven't finished the EIT derivation, which I am
            hoping to pick up on in the next few days before spring semester starts.
            The good news, though, is that we have finally found a diode laser that does the job (for a whopping $350), so I suppose
            we can really start setting up the rest of the experiment now...<br><br>

            The last two weeks have been quite hectic: lots of philosophy reading as usual (well... not really because I only
            skimmed through the papers with minimal effort), a midterm AND a final exam that were 6 days apart, and the
            <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/"target="_blank">MCM</a>, which was basically a
            4-day mathematical-modeling-athon. Oh, and of course frisbee practices at the worst of times.
            I managed most of that, but I was clearly wrong about the chill level of this JanPlan. Here are what to come:<br>

            <ul class="a">
              <li>I will hopefully be presenting my summer research with my professor
                at <a href="https://www.aps.org/units/damop/meetings/annual/">DAMOP19</a>.
              Link to the (updating) poster <a href="research/DAMOP19.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
              Sounds fancy, but the objective is more to be there and get to know what the experts in AMO and Quantum Information are doing
              rather than reprenseting what I've done after my first year in college.
              I'm actually quite excited for this,
              not just because this is my first ever conference
              but also because my future boss is going to be there... More on than in the next bullet point. </li><br>
              <li>Working on securing my position at a lab for the summer. And yep, I'll probably meet my future boss at the
              DAMOP conference in May. At this point it's just paperwork, but still technically "work."</li><br>
              <li>Right now I have to prioritize working on the extended abstract and re-making the poster for the conference,
                but of course I want to refocus on completing the notes and improving the site after that. After all,
              my idea of the site is to have a nice place to put and share the notes and learn
              web design. </li>
            </ul>
            Some interesting stuff I've found on the internet recently:
            <ul class="a">
              <li><a href="http://phdcomics.com/movie/" target="_blank">The PHD movies</a>. Absolutely hilarious and well-made.
              It was also filmed on <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>
              campus and featured some of the professors and graduate students there. Totally worth the $10 to watch both of the movies.</li>
            </ul>

            Lab update: I probably spent at least 3 hours untangling a not-very-well-put-together circuit. Have to say
            the task was quite fun but not enjoyable at times when a solder iron and pliers were the only means of solving
            that messy, possibly accidental, puzzle. One thing I learned from doing quite a bit of soldering recently:
            sometimes not having such a bright light source makes soldering easier. The problem with a lot of light is
            a lot of reflection. Having a less direct light source and paying attention to the silhouttes of the components can give
            a better "feel" to where the components are, their relative sizes, and whether there are short-circuits. <br>
            <br>
            You can probably tell that the website is bare simple. The reasons are that (i) I like it this way, and (ii) I'm
            building it from scratch as a way to learn HTML and CSS - similar to how to I write "<a href="a-quick-guide-to.html">
            A Quick Guide to...</a>" as way to learn $\LaTeX$.<br>

        First good news: A major website update. I removed a few pages that I don't often visit and replaced them with
        the new "Research" page where I talk about my undergraduate research experience. I also did a bunch of background clean-ups,
        hopefully improving my efficiency when I implement future updates.<br>
        <br>
        Second good news - lab work: The dither circuit for the laser-frequency stabilization system that I spent hours constructing
        over winter break was tested and passed "quality control" today. Want to know what a dither circuit
        does? Stay tuned, as I will be updating this blog post over the next few days.<br>

      Took a 2-day hiatus from writing the notes to focus
      on getting the laser-locking dither circuit to work and tweaking the website. Good news: (1) the circuit works,
      and (2) my site now supports $\LaTeX.$ JanPlan starts tomorrow,
      which means lots of philosophy readings, notes-writing, lab work, and of course frisbee practice. But I've found a
      few interesting on the internet:<br>
      <ul class="a">
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k9j0KY2qoM&t=4534s">Don Quixote ballet - Minkus</a>:
              Beautiful melodies, especially all of the Kitri variations. Been listening to this composition for the past 2-3 weeks.
                Found the music through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlXCk1LDlC0">
                    Alina Zagitova's 2018 Olympic program</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4gRWR3X0Y0&t=5798s">
                        ballet</a> is also amazing to watch. </li>
        <br>
          <li> Check out <a href="https://brilliant.org/problems/kitris-variation-i/?ref_id=1558157">this</a>,
              <a href="https://brilliant.org/problems/kitris-variation-act-ii/?ref_id=1558229">this</a>, and
                <a href="https://brilliant.org/problems/kitris-variation-act-iii/?ref_id=1558999">this</a> - fun
                little adventures of Kitri and Basilio that I came up with.</li>
