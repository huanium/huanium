        I've been working with professor Charles Conover at Colby College since my freshman spring. The ongoing project
          at the time I joined the lab was measuring energy spacings between Rydberg states of ultracold potassium atoms to
          high precision (to a part in 10 million). Ultracold K atoms are prepared in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and
          laser-cooled to around 1 mK. More details coming soon<br>

        My first lab experiene was constructing a laser frequency locking circuit, which takes in a reference signal
        from the photodiodes and an "error" signal, and produces a feedback signal that keeps the laser wavelength at fixed value.
        More details coming soon<br>

        I worked on a number of small projects over summer, but spent a big chunk in the end
        studying how we could apply Ramsey's separated oscillatory fields method with our current set up
        to perform high-precision spectrsocopy. More details coming soon. <br>

          I spend most of my summer research at Conover's lab studying how we could use Ramsey's oscillatory field method
          to make high-precision measurements without the need for AC Stark shift elimination. While this was an experimental project,
          there was not much experimental work involved, as we already had a functioning system for high-precision spectroscopy: (i) Rydberg
          excitation, (ii) DC-Stark shift elimination, (iii) AC-Stark shift elimination. To run the Ramsey experiment, I simply replaced
          the previous single-pulse Rydberg excitation with a double-pulse Rydberg excitation (which produced Ramsey fringes),
          and removed step (iii). It turned out probably 10% of the time was spent on taking data, while the rest went to
          deriving (from Ramsey's 1950 paper) a model for fitting the data to find the desired (with zero AC-Startk shift) transition
          frequency.<br>
          <br>
          I presented this work at Colby Undergraduate Summer Research Retreat 2018 (CUSRR 2018). Check out my poster
          <a href="research\CUSRR2018.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
          <br>
          I will reproduce the derivation for the model here later when I have time. But if you are curious, check out the
          handwritten version <a href="research\Ramsey_1950_derivation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The end result was correct
          but the path I took could be misleading for unfamiliar readers, so beware!<br>
          <br>
          Want to get interactive? Download and run this <a href="research\Ramsey.nb" target="_blank">simulation<a> in Mathematica
          and play around with the Rabi rate, $\Omega$, delay time, $t$, and pulse width, $\tau$, and see how the
          data (population of the excited state) changes.<br>
