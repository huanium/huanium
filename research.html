        I've been working with professor Charles Conover at Colby College since my freshman spring. The ongoing project
          at the time I joined the lab was measuring energy spacings between Rydberg states of ultracold potassium atoms to
          high precision (to a part in 10 million). Ultracold K atoms are prepared in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and
          laser-cooled to around 1 mK. More details coming soon<br>

        My first lab experience was constructing a laser frequency locking circuit, which takes in a reference signal
        from the photodiodes and an "error" signal, and produces a feedback signal that keeps the laser wavelength at fixed value.
        More details coming soon<br>
        <br>
        I worked on a number of small projects over the summer of 2018, but spent a big chunk in the end
        studying how we could apply Ramsey's separated oscillatory fields method with our current set up
        to perform high-precision spectrsocopy. More details coming soon. <br>

    <div class="collapsible"><b>Theoretical: Quantum meanderings</b></div>
      <div class="content">
          I'm interested in quantum information, atomic physics, quantum optics and laser specstrocopy theory.
          I've been learning these topics in my own time from Paul Berman's <i>Principles of Laser Spectroscopy and Quantum Optics</i>,
          scientific papers provided by Professor Conover, and other sources. I'm also an avid consumer of
          linear algebra material, from class (MA253 with Otto Bretscher and MA353 with Leo Livshits) and other sources such as
          <a href="https://brilliant.org/community/home/">Brilliant.org</a> or quantum mechanics material online (UMD, MIT online lecture notes).
          <br><br>
          I'm not necessary trying to keep my quantum mechancis self-study tightly structured. I like picking up new concepts
          as I encounter them. For example, if I'm going to be working on an <a href="archives/EIT/EIT.pdf">EIT</a> experiment,
          I'd try to learn as much as possible about it, both the theoretical and experimental aspects.
          This unstructured style allows me to explore topics outside what research or class that I might be curious about.
          <br><br>
          I'm working on an Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (<a href="archives/EIT/EIT.pdf">EIT</a>) experiment
          in the near future. More updates coming soon.<br><br>

    <div class="collapsible"><b>Summer 2018: Ramsey's Separated Oscillating Field Method</b></div>
        <div class="content">
          I spend most of my summer research at Conover's lab studying how we could use Ramsey's oscillating field method
          to make high-precision measurements without the need for AC Stark shift elimination. While this was an experimental project,
          there was not much experimental work involved, as we already had a functioning system for high-precision spectroscopy: (i) Rydberg
          excitation, (ii) DC-Stark shift elimination, (iii) AC-Stark shift elimination. To run the Ramsey experiment, I simply replaced
          the previous single-pulse Rydberg excitation with a double-pulse Rydberg excitation (which produced Ramsey fringes),
          and removed step (iii). It turned out probably 10% of the time was spent on taking data, while the rest went to
          deriving (from Ramsey's 1950 paper) a model for fitting the data to find the desired (with zero AC-Startk shift) transition
          frequency.<br>
          <br>
          I presented this work at Colby Undergraduate Summer Research Retreat 2018 (CUSRR 2018). Check out my poster
          <a href="research\CUSRR2018.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
          <br>
          The derivation for the model (still being revised)
          can be found <a href="archives/Ramsey/Ramsey_theory.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
          I reproduced this derivation from the
          handwritten version <a href="research\Ramsey_1950_derivation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
          which I made over summer. The end result in the handwritten version was correct
          but the path I took could be misleading for unfamiliar readers, so beware!<br>
          <br>
          Want to get interactive? Download and run this <a href="research\Ramsey.nb" target="_blank">simulation<a> in Mathematica
          and play around with the Rabi rate, $\Omega$, delay time, $t$, and pulse width, $\tau$. See how the
          population of the excited state (square amplitude of the excited state's wavefunction)
          changes as a function of detuning $\delta$.<br>
          <br>

          Basically, the population of atoms in the excited state can be modelled by this equation:<br><br>
          $$P_2 = 4\sin^{2}\theta\sin^{2}\frac{\Omega'\tau}{2} \left\lbrace \cos \frac{\Omega'\tau}{2}\cos \frac{\Delta_0 T}{2} - \cos\theta\sin\frac{\Omega'\tau}{2} \sin \frac{\Delta_0 T}{2}\right\rbrace$$
          Fitting the model to our measurements give something like this:<br><br>

              ECDL stands for "External Cavity Diode Laser." One can probably guess there are two parts to an ECDL:
              the external cavity and the diode laser. Diode lasers are commonly known.  <br>
