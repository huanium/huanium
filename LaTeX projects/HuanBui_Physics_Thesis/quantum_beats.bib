	abstract = {A theoretical study of quantum-beat intensity profiles is presented for the case of zero-field hyperfine-structure beats. By means of the graphical methods of angular-momentum theory, an explicit expression for the quantum-beat profiles, in the form of a multipole expansion is obtained.}
