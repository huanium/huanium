	\textbf{Personal Statement}
\end{center}
%My accomplishments would not have been possible without the support from my family and professors. While there have been challenges, overcoming them and learning about others' experiences have enriched my life and encouraged me to support less privileged individuals in my community. \\ 

My parents' income as Vietnamese public physicians was far from sufficient to cover my tuition. To reduce costs, I earn additional financial aid from Colby by consistently being in the top 5\% of my class. I also participate in work-study as a teaching assistant, where I enjoyed helping others academically and learning about their backgrounds. Now that my parents have retired, the Ph.D. program is an ideal way for me to advance in academia and become financially independent. \\


Being an international student among recent events vastly limited my research opportunities beyond Colby, but I did not let these factors affect my training. A delay in OPT processing in 2019 curtailed my Joint Quantum Institute internship. However, I self-studied quantum mechanics in the meantime and ultimately learned a great deal from the internship. Recently, the pandemic thwarted my chance to work with qudits at the Institute for Quantum Computing. I thus interned at the Perimeter Institute where the theoretical nature of my project alleviated many difficulties associated with its online format.  \\

I have been extremely fortunate, and there is no doubt that even my biggest obstacles are merely mishaps for some. I can pursue my passion for physics and help others because Colby has provided me with an inclusive and encouraging environment. At MIT and beyond, I wish to emulate such an environment to inspire young scientists.\\
