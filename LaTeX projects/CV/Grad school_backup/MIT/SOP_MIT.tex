	\textbf{Statement of Objectives}
\end{center}
My name is Huan Bui, and I study physics and mathematics with a statistics minor at Colby College. I am drawn to the interplay between theory and experiment in quantum information and condensed-matter physics.  In May 2021, I will complete my undergraduate studies at Colby with two Honors Theses on experimental atomic physics and mathematical physics. The natural next step for me is to apply my research training to address a fundamental open problem in quantum science, and the Physics Ph.D. program at MIT is a fantastic option to that end.  \\ 

My most current interest is in simulation of quantum many-body systems. With Dr. Timothy Hsieh at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, I am researching efficient variational simulation of quantum states that are not adiabatically connected to unentangled product states. Motivated by variational quantum eigensolver algorithms and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Dr. Hsieh recently developed a protocol that could target a class of such non-trivial quantum states with perfect fidelity using an L/2-deep QAOA ansatz, where L is the system size. We initially aimed to accelerate this protocol. However, after I discovered numerically that it could also target the ground state of the transverse-field Ising model with random field and couplings, the research focus shifted towards understanding how QAOA gives such a good ansatz. Since then, I have further found numerically that an (L+1)- and a modified L/2-deep ansatz could simulate excited states of this model and the ground state of any disordered Ising Hamiltonian, respectively. My next goal is to explore Dr. Hsieh's conjectures related to this fascinating behavior of the QAOA ansatz. Ultimately, we aim to establish relationships between the current protocol and the ability to target many-body localized states.\\

My interest in quantum information science stems from my research experiences in ultracold atom experiments at the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) and Colby College. In Summer 2019, I joined the Rolston group at JQI to study the long-range interaction between rubidium atoms magneto-optically trapped around an optical nanofiber. There, I built an imaging system for optimizing light polarization in optical nanofibers, which often introduce birefringence and undesirable longitudinal polarizations. I also developed a stand-alone Python program for controlling the entire experiment, removing the group's reliance on the less compatible LabView program. In January 2020, Dr. Hyok Sang Han and I observed a mysterious transient decay flash in the rubidium population that was much faster than even the fastest superradiance mode of the system. Since this phenomenon was only recently discovered and not well-understood in the one-dimensional geometry of our nanofiber experiment, the group at JQI is constructing a model to study it in more detail.   \\ 

At Colby, I work on ultracold potassium experiments under Professor Charles Conover, my advisor and mentor. Applying the experimental techniques I learned at JQI, I am working towards a Physics Honors Thesis on lifetime measurements of quantum states in potassium by counting photons emitted from an excited, magneto-optically trapped, atomic cloud of this species. In previous years, I have constructed a variety of laboratory apparatus from external-cavity diode lasers to laser frequency-stabilization electronics and carried out precision spectroscopy on potassium in Rydberg states to determine its quantum defects and absolute energy levels. At our level of precision, energy shifts due to the millimeter-wave source are significant and thus require data extrapolation to obtain unbiased measurements. Applying Ramsey's separated oscillatory field method, I eliminated this necessity and gave an alternative measurement scheme with comparable precision. I presented this work at Colby's summer research symposium in 2018 and at DAMOP 19.  \\

Besides physics research, I have been developing my communication skills through working as a teaching assistant for a wide range of courses from Linear Algebra to Quantum Mechanics. I have also been exploring other areas of physics and mathematics. For four semesters with Professor Robert Bluhm, I studied general relativity and classical field theory and reviewed massive gravity along with its nonlinear effects. This resulted in my detailed exposition of the subjects, which is available on my website. Last year, I began my Mathematics Honors Thesis under Professor Evan Randles on convolution powers of complex-valued functions, which are a central object for generating solutions for partial differential equations. Motivated by my numerical evidence, we recently constructed from measure theory an integration formula for estimating the Fourier transform of special surface-carried measures. We are preparing a manuscript summarizing this result and will present it at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in January 2021. \\ 

At MIT, I would like to focus my efforts on researching quantum information and condensed-matter physics. I have contacted Professor Soonwon Choi, who will be starting at MIT in July 2021. His research on quantum many-body systems and quantum information dynamics aligns directly with my current interests. I also contacted Professor Martin Zwierlein and am interested in his upcoming experiment on rotating quantum gases to investigate quantum Hall physics. Finally, I am attracted to both theoretical and experimental aspects of Professor Isaac Chuang's research. Upon receiving my Ph.D., I aim to continue research in these fields and eventually teach at a research-oriented university. I believe that admission to the Physics Ph.D. program at MIT is an excellent first step towards this goal. \\
