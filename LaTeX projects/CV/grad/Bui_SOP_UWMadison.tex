	\textbf{Statement of Purpose}
\end{center}
I am captivated by the interplay between theory and experiment in quantum information science and atomic, molecular, and optical physics. In particular, I am interested in quantum simulation and computation as well as experiments with ultracold gases for quantum science and fundamental physics. In May 2021, I will complete my undergraduate studies at Colby College with two Honors Theses on experimental atomic physics and mathematical analysis. My next objective is to expand and subsequently apply my research training to address an important open problem in quantum science. To that end, the Physics Ph.D. program at UW Madison is a fantastic option.  \\

At Madison, I would like to focus my efforts on quantum science and expanding my teaching capacity. I have contacted Professor Robert McDermott and am interested in his work on quantum computing  with superconducting qubits. I am also attracted to Professor Mark Saffman's research on neutral atom quantum computing, which aligns well with my experience in ultracold atom experiments. Upon receiving my Ph.D., I aim to continue research in quantum science and eventually teach at a research-oriented university. Ultimately, I would like to make impactful contributions to the continually growing body of work in this field. I believe that admission to the Physics Ph.D. program at Madison is an ideal step towards this goal. \\

\noindent Thank you for your consideration. \\
