	\textbf{Candidate Statement}
\end{center}
I am captivated by the interplay between theory and experiment in quantum information science, condensed matter, and atomic, molecular, and optical physics. I have developed this fascination from my experiences in quantum simulations and experiments with ultracold quantum gases. In May 2021, I will complete my undergraduate studies at Colby College with two Honors Theses on experimental atomic physics and mathematical analysis. My next objective is to expand and subsequently apply my research training to address an important open problem in quantum science. To that end, the Physics Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago is a fantastic option.  \\ 

\input{content}

At Chicago, I would like to focus my efforts on quantum science and expanding my teaching capacity. I have contacted Professor Jonathan Simon and am interested in his research on photonic materials and his collaboration with Professor David Schuster on hybrid quantum systems. In addition, I find Professor David DeMille's experimental work on precision measurements very appealing. Upon receiving my Ph.D., I aim to continue research in quantum science and eventually teach at a research-oriented university. Ultimately, I would like to make impactful contributions to the continually growing body of work in this field. I believe that admission to the Physics Ph.D. program at Chicago is an ideal step towards this goal. \\

\noindent Thank you for your consideration. \\
