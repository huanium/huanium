    "In our experiment we begin with a thermal mixture of $^{23}$ Na in the hyperfine state $\\ket{F=1, m_F=1}$ and $^{40}$ K in the hyperfine state $\\ket{F=9/2, m_F = -9/2}$ at around 100 G. A Blackman pulse of duration ~ 100 ms with Rabi frequency ~ 5 kHz is turned on. The frequency $\\omega_\\text{rf}$ of the rf field is tuned across the resonance for the $m_F = -9/2 \\to m_F = -7/2$ resonance in $^{40}$ K. There are two relevant Na-K scattering lengths which we denote $a_{-9/2}$ and $a_{-7/2}$. At 100 G, we have $a_{-9/2} = -1698 a_0$ and $a_{-7/2} = 644 a_0$, which means there is a two-body bound state of NaK with between $\\ket{^{23}\\text{Na}, F=1, m_F=1}$ and $\\ket{^{40} \\text{K}, F=9/2, m_F = -9/2}$ and no bound state of NaK with $^{40}$ K in $m_F = -9/2$. It is thus possible to create these bound states (a.k.a. Feshbach molecules) using the rf field when $\\omega_\\text{rf}$ is from the bare hyperfine resonance $\\omega_\\text{HF}$ an amount $E_b$ that is the molecule binding energy. The molecule association lineshape is known exactly. \n",

In our experiment, we observed the lineshape to have a threshold behavior with a high-frequency tail. We know this has to do with the interaction with the Na bath, have not found a satisfactory quantitative model for this rf response. The goal of this notebook is to put together what we know and what we need to know in order to find this lineshape. There are at least two ways to get the rf response for our system. One is via Fermi's Golden Rule, and the other is the Green's function-spectral function method. We shall focus on the latter."

    "The case of interacting fermions ($\\uparrow, \\downarrow$) of equal masses is then done, at least to first order in $z$. From the self-energy, we can then compute the retarded Green's function via the Dyson's equation. The spectral function is directly related to the imaginary part of the Green's function. Following [Zwerger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.1333.pdf), one can then extract the rf response from the spectral function depending on the initial and final states.\n",
